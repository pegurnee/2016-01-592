### big data
- extremely large data sets that may be analyzed computationally to reveal patterns, trends and association
- complex for processing by traditional database management tools
-require new an powerful computational resources to process

- high volume, high velocity, and high variety information
- structured and unstructured
- analyzed for insights that lead to better decisions

- large database sets
  - structured or semistructured
  - continuously streaming information
  - volumes in the multiple tera to petabytes range and beyond

- scale out infrastructure
  - massively distributed
  - linear scalability
  - commodity hardware

- intelligent software
  - machine learning
  - natural language processing
  - A/B Testing

### roles
- data engineer
  - system implementation
  - programming
  - db administration
  - data storage
- data scientist
  - story-telling
  - data modeling
  - statistics
  - visualization

### three Vs
- volume
- variety
  - sensor data
  - media
- velocity
- veracity
  - accuracy of data

### cloud computing
a model for enabling ubiquitous, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction
- big data is the biggest application of the cloud computing environment with nosql as an enabler
